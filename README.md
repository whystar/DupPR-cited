| 1 |  <div style="width: 200pt">I saw your PR and there wasn't any activity or follow up in that from last 18 days</div> | https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25385|
| 2 | Oh, Sorry I did not search for a previous PR before submitting a PR |https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4540#issuecomment-64949848|	
| 3	| Ah should have searched first, thanks | https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4897#issuecomment-70928570	|
| 4	|Ah, my bad. I thought I searched, but I must have only been looking at open| https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/4897#issuecomment-70928570	|
| 5 |Sorry, I searched before pushing but did not find your PR...| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/10261#issuecomment-35085532	|
| 6 | apologies, I did search before posting (forget the search term I used) but clearly my search was bad... Thanks for finding the dup| https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/7846#issuecomment-46169161	|
| 7 | ...This is a dup of that PR. I should have looked harder as I didn't see that one when I created this one... | https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/19186#issuecomment-228624172	|
| 8 | Uhm yeah, didn't spot the reference in #21967| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/21984#issuecomment-286071552	|
| 9	| Argh, didn't see it in the original issue. Need more coffee I guess	| https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3853#issuecomment-157026180	|
| 10	| I'm glad to hear that. But please link your future PRs to the issues	|https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6135#issuecomment-192607456	|
| 11	| Yeah I will, that's on me!	| https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6135#issuecomment-192714576	|
| 12	| missed the mail for the PR it seems :-/	| https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43902#issuecomment-290678265	|
| 13	| We are working on this	| https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8503#issuecomment-284164838	|
| 14	| I just realized someone was also working on it after I committed	| https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/8517#issuecomment-284167829	|
| 15	| Since the PR also contains some test cleanup, I'll merge that instead and close this one. But thank you for the efforts, it is much appreciated!!	| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/8213#issuecomment-22700404	|
| 16	| After a short discussion internally, we are going to close this one in favour of merging #7666. This is nothing more than the fact that the other PR touches much less files.	| https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/7557#issuecomment-234108910	|
| 17	| Closing this in favor of #10373, which also contains performance improvements.	| https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/pull/10253#issuecomment-19426728	|
| 18	| Looks like #2716 fixed this though the quoting on that one is not 100% right and I prefer your solution... Would you like to rebase yours on top of head to use the '+=(...)' operator?	| https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/2694#issuecomment-65351542	|
| 19	| This PR is a subset of PR #16031	| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/16527#issuecomment-156073275	|
| 20	| closing this PR as a duplicate of #5193 (the latter is sent against 2.0 which is the branch to target for bugfix) 	| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/5075#issuecomment-7525584	|
| 21	| Thanks for the fix. Not sure we want to merge this or wait for #3907 which also fixes it and adds a regression test for all estimators	| https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4205#issuecomment-73034904	|
| 22	| Actually, I see that #28026 is at the head of the merge queue right now, so it will probably merge bfore this one, in which case we can just discard this PR. 	| https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/28037#issuecomment-228446935	|
| 23	| Thank you very much for opening the pull request @xxx. Sadly I have to close it nonetheless because someone already opened one with the same changes before: #5761	| https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5764#issuecomment-146268713	|
| 24	| @xxx The original author of that PR hasn't responded in a week. If you want to fix the tests in your PR, we could merge this one. Your call	| https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6657#issuecomment-215867866	|
| 25	| @xxx do you mind if we close this in favor of #12004 from a new contributor? 	| https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11989#issuecomment-229935713	|
| 26	| Replaced by #5067	| https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/5018#issuecomment-114960773	|
| 27	| closing in favour of #10582	| https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/10499#issuecomment-92678993	|
| 28	| I prefer this behavior (and its simpler implementation) Can you please cherry-pick the test from #20050	| https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20697#issuecomment-115106313	|
| 29	| along with adding an changelog entry listing both authors	| https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20697#issuecomment-115106313	|
| 30	| Can you credit him in the commit as well after you squash and rebase	| https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24719#issuecomment-219453158	|
| 31	| Other PR didn't get updated today and the failures were annoying on new PRs.	| https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5236#issuecomment-150436811	|
| 32	| Could you jump on #3082 and help us review it?	| https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/2835#issuecomment-20802286	|
| 33	| Please work with @xxx to test his code once he fixes the merge conflicts	| https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/4034#issuecomment-33486138	|
| 34	| Made a minor note on the other PR to include one of the improvements	| https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10753#issuecomment-272082861	|
| 35	| Looks like they took my advice and used proc terminate() so another package was not needed. Thanks for catching duplicate, but at least it was not a waste. :)	| https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/5457#issuecomment-8380130	|
| 36	| it probably makes sens to just center around a single effort	| https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/3261#issuecomment-28116000	|
| 37	| No need to do the same thing in two PRs	| https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/46913#discussion_r120145506	|
| 38	| Oops! Sorry, did not mean to double up	| https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/12576#issuecomment-194558365	|
| 39	| The pull requests are different, so maybe it is good there are two.	| https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3948#issuecomment-105055797	|
| 40	| Pick me! Pick me! I was first! :)	| https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/2540#issuecomment-17643473	|
| 41	|  I looked at some awesome code that xxx wrote to fix this issue and it was so simple, I just did not fully understand the issue I was fixing.	| https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6121#issuecomment-192509271	|
| 42	| @xxx, btw, it is a good idea to comment on an issue when you start working on it, so we can coordinate better and avoid duplication of effort	| https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/15106#issuecomment-245642887	|
| 43	| Thanks for your PR but this fix is already merged in #20610	| https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/15608#issuecomment-302597771	|
| 44	| 'already' implies I submitted my PR later than that, rather than nearly a year earlier ;) But at least it’s fixed.	| https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/15608#issuecomment-302647921	|
| 45	| sorry, sometimes a PR falls in the cracks and a newer one gets the attention. We have improved the process in hopes to avoid this but we still have a big backlog in which these things are present.	| https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/15608#issuecomment-302700216	|
| 46	| I wish there has been some automated method to detect pending PR per file basis. This could save lot of work duplicacy. ...	| https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/8394#issuecomment-228664095	|
| 47	| It’s strange that GitHub isn't complaining about this, because it’s an exact dup of #5131 which was merged already	| https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/5226#issuecomment-40560850	|
